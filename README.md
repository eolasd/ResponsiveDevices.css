*Fresh, responsive CSS-only devices that scale with your content and look great on any screen!*

It's rather annoying to have badly scaled CSS devices on your landing/demo page. Often they'll not quite fit your screenshots properly, and may resize badly on certain devices, resulting in clunky scrollbars.

responsiveDevices.css fixes that by giving you simple, componentised CSS classes to 'build' your own components. All the classes are responsive and you can add or remove features (such as speakers or screen reflections).

## Devices

- Android Phone (16:9 aspect ratio)
- iPhone (16:9 aspect ratio)
- iPhoneX (16:9 aspect ratio)
- Android Tablet (4:3 aspect ratio)
- iPad (4:3 aspect ratio)
- iMac (16:9 aspect ratio)

You just need to worry about setting the correct aspect ratio for your content, and the CSS classes will take care of scaling themselves. Your demo pages will look great on any screen!

All devices are available in black and white skins, except the iMac :)
